## Introduction
This project was put together for the NCSSM J-Term on open source science. I used data from the World Health Organization's [Global Cancer Observatory](https://gco.iarc.fr/). In their database, they have a dataset of time trends of cancer incidence and mortality for over half a century from 60 countries. I chose to look specifically at the **lung cancer incidence** in the US, and the differences between male and female cancer patients.
