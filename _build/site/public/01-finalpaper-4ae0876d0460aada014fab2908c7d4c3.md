Here is a summary of my work.

## Introduction
This project was put together for the NCSSM J-Term on open source science. I used data from the World Health Organization's [Global Cancer Observatory](https://gco.iarc.fr/). In their database, they have a dataset of time trends of cancer incidence and mortality for over half a century from 60 countries. I chose to look specifically at the **lung cancer incidence** in the US, and the differences between male and female cancer patients.

:::{dropdown} What is crude rate?
:open:
The crude rate is the ratio of the number of new cases in a specified population and time period to the size of the population at risk during the same time period. Incidence rate is usually presented as an annual rate per 100,000 persons at risk. [ECIS](https://ecis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/info/glossary.html)
